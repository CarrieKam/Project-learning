#React 

----
React Hook that lets you add a [state variable](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory) to your component

Convention:
The convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]` using [array destructuring.](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment)
```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

- [`useState(initialState)`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#usestate)
- [`set` functions, like `setSomething(nextState)`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#setstate)
