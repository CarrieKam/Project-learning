# React.FC
React.FC stands for “Functional Component” and is a type provided by the React library in TypeScript. It’s a generic type that allows you to define a function component and specify the type of props it expects to receive.

## Why use React.FC?

Using React.FC provides several benefits:

1. **Type safety**: It ensures that the component is used correctly and provides type information for the component’s props.
2. **Easy refactoring**: If you need to rename a prop, the TypeScript compiler will catch any places where that prop is used and help you update them.
3. **Clear prop shape**: The type definition makes it easy to see the expected shape of a component’s props.
