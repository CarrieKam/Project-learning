FOUC is the short moment of truth when you catch your friend turning their head without the zoom filter applied - and often, it isÂ _aesthetically less appealing_, just like the example above before the transition happened. FOUC poses a very bad user experience, especially for new visitors who are not aware of this phenomenon. They might even think that your website poses a security threat (my mom asks me that a lot for new sites she visit). Even for users who know of this phenomenon, by its existence, the lag and abruptness of the transition decreases the legitimacy and professionalism of a website.
